          <h2> SUNDAY </h2>
          <h3> Gatherings </h2>
          <p> Sunday gatherings are primarily made up of worship and teaching. Worship simply means to ascribe worth to someone or something. Biblical worship is a full life response to who God is and what He has done. Our teaching is focused on taking the truths of the Bible and explaining them in a thought-provoking manner that makes sense today—as a narrative. We spend most of the year preaching through books of the Bible with occasional breaks for topical, culturally-relevant series.</p>

          <h2> DISCIPLESHIP </h2>
          <h3> Groups </h2>
          <p> Discipleship groups are small groups meant to remind eachother of our value simply because we were created as image bearers of God. Members get to know eachother well and have the opportunity to love one another intentionally. Jesus knew how to live freely amidst the brokenness of the human condition and our world’s chaos. When we follow his rhythms of life, we walk in steadfast footprints: seeking intimacy with God, enjoying biblical community, and living with purpose as we share the gospel and how to abide in him with others.</p>

          <h2> COMMUNITY </h2>
          <h3> Events </h2>
          <p> We hold different events throughout the year. Some are just for women or men, while others are for both or even the whole family. Regardless, we try to not plan activities for activities’ sake. (If anything, we all need to slow down a little and clear our calendars more.) Each event is designed with detailed intentionality to help us do just that: slow down and orient our lives around Jesus. </p>
